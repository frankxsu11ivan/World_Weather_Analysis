# Module 6: APIs

## Overview
** The activities in Module 6 is understanding APIs. 
We are challenged to create a dataFrame of City Weather Data that is used from the modules and through challenges. 
Random numbers and citipy are merged for the data frame.
lessons learned include:
 * Making API calls using Python's request library
 * Traversing JSONs
 * Making calls to weather_api and google_api
 * Storing API data in Pandas DataFrames to call 
 * GMaps are a hoot. when they work and render.

## Overview of Project
 *PlanMyTrip app is the project. 
 *Added weather description to the weather data youâ€™ve already retrieved in module 6. 
 *Filter the data for travelers weather preferences is the basis of the app. 
 *then the preference ofweather is used to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels
 *ultimately the PlanMyTrip app is used for a road trip. I chose as a mode of traffic to'BIKING' and green outline as route.

## Results
 *Limitations of this dataset of this data set is the distance between cities.
 *the maps are huge and rendering is a limitation. in the gmap tool.

 *other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are tied to food network dives and diners ... next to ATMS.
 *this will take more practice in gMaps.
